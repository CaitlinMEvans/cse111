# When you physically exercise to strengthen your heart, you
# should maintain your heart rate within a range for at least 20 minutes. To find that range, subtract your age from 220.
# This difference is your maximum heart rate per minute. Your heart simply will not beat faster than this maximum (220 - age).
# When exercising to strengthen your heart, you should keep your heart rate between 65% and 85% of your heartâ€™s maximum rate.
